# React-Redux-group-project
 In this activity, our team will be preparing a Kanban board with a GitHub project. We have a template ready for us to use, which we need to copy. Each task in the template board has a workload and a category assigned to it. My responsibility will be to divide the tasks in a manner that allows each team member to work on tasks from all categories
